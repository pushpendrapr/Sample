Agile and Framework
-------------------
Agile software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.

Agile Frameworks-------
SAFe
Scrum
Crystal
Kanban
eXtreme Programming (XP)
Features-Driven Development
Test-Driven Development

=====================================================
Agile Principle---------
# Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
# Working software is the primary measure of progress.
# Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
# The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
# Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

=====================================================
Scrum  and Scrum Values
-----------------------
Scrum is agile framework that helps teams to deliver customer value in small iteration.
A lightweight framework designed to manage complex product development.

Scrum Values
Courage 
Commitment 
Focus 
Respect 
Openness 

======================================================
Product Owner---------

Scrum Master----------

Scrum Team
----------
Cross functional team
Self-Organizing, collaboration 
Committed to task
Deliver business values in small chunks
Everyone who is needed to define, build and test.
Work on items in an order set by the product owner

Agile Terminology

Capacity
Load
Velocity
Acceleration

======================================================
Agile Terminology
-----------------

EPIC > Capability > Feature > User Story
Enablers (Refactor, Spike), Stretch Item)

As a <User Role> I want <Activity> so that <Business Value>
•	User Role is the description of the person doing the action.
•	Activity is what they can do with the system.
•	Business value is why they want to do the activity.

======================================================

Agile Ceremonies
----------------
	
1. Sprint Planning
------------------
•	PO presents stories in order of priority.
•	Each story
	-	Is discussed and analyzed by the team.
	-	Has its acceptance criteria defined and refined.
	-	Is estimated.
•	The team breaks stories into tasks.

==============================

Acceptance Criteria
•	Acceptance criteria provide the details of the Story from a testing point of view.
•	Acceptance criteria express the conditions that need to be satisfied for the customer.
•	Acceptance criteria provide context for the team, more details of the story, help the team know when they are done.
•	Acceptance criteria are written by the customer/PO and refined by the team during backlog grooming and iteration planning.

=====================================================

2. Daily Stand-up
-----------------
o	What did I complete yesterday?
o	What am I working on today?
o	What is slowing me down?

The DSU is not a daily status meeting for management. It is used to: 
•	Share information about progress
•	Coordinate activities
•	Raise blocking issues

=====================================================

3. Backlog Grooming
-------------------
Backlog represents opportunities, not commitments.

Backlog Grooming where user stories are prioritizes, right-sized and estimated. Backlog grooming is when the product owner and scrum team review items on the backlog to ensure the backlog contains the appropriate items, that they are prioritized.
•	Removing user stories that no longer appear relevant
•	Creating new user stories in response to newly discovered needs
•	Re-assessing the relative priority of stories
•	Provides time to identify dependencies and issues that could impact the next sprint. Ensures that we have a ready backlog for Sprint planning.

=====================================================

4. Review Meeting
-----------------
•	Provides the true measure of progress by showing working functionality.
•	Preparation for the review starts with planning.
•	Teams demonstrate every Story, Enabler.
•	Attendees are the team and its stackholders. (Stakeholders mostly join System review instead of Sprint review)
•	If major stackholders cannot attend, the PO should follow up individually. 

=====================================================

5. Retrospective
----------------
Agile Teams continuously adapt to new circumstances and improve the methods of value delivery.
•	Understand where you are
•	Foster the culture of ‘improving everywhere’
•	Use retrospectives as summary points but not as limitations.
•	Supports continuous learning.

============================================================

Definition of Ready

Definition of Done

What does ‘Done” mean
Goal for the end of every Sprint:
•	Working system
•	No remaining work
•	Everyone on same page regarding what was completed
•	Standard followed
•	Work accepted by the PO
•	NFRs too (Non-Function requirement)
