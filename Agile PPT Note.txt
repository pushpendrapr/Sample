6. Agile Ceremonies

7. Sprint Planning
- Before we move to planning, we do: Estimation and high-level COA.
- DEV and QA should understand acceptance criteria without assumptions.
- Without proper COS how we accept US?
- We should define the task and own in the beginning.  
- Design session is not the place to understand COA, Show technical approach.
Q Test approach and QA scripting. If single task the update comment.

8. Stand-up
- How many are really do this 1st part?
- DSU is place holder to share progress for US and coordinate with team. 
- DSU is not the time to discuss the technical things. 
- 2 incident happened last week and issues won't come just before stand-up.
- Send mail or schedule meeting. Ask for availability. Attach mail clarification if it's necessary.

9. Backlog Grooming

- Point Estimation (Planning poker, T-shirt Size, Bucket System

10. Sprint Review (Code Review/SME Check)
> Why do we need code review ?
> Why it's happening after handing over to QA?

- Code review should be done by SME, to identify loophole before QA notice.
- Sprint review should be with PO for functionality Check, not the technical approach.
- QA can own this as per availability.
