In the recent times, we could see some uncleanness in whistling duck conference room. Tea/Coffee spilled on the table with undisposed paper cups, used tissue paper left on the table & Biscuits dribbled on the floor. It questions the calibration of our decorum.
It is our collective responsibility to maintain the work place with cleanliness and tidiness. It would be great if we follow the basic decorum to keep the work area clean & neat.

Kudos to everyone and team for your excellent effort and contribution towards delivering value to the customer on time, even though there were struggle at last minute due to environment unavailability. 
“I wanted to extend my appreciation to each on every one of you on the defect train for the extraordinary efforts you put forth to reach this goal. We had some challenges, to put it mildly. I shared in your frustration over the environment issues. They put a lot of pressure on us as a team.
However, you rose the occasion in the big way. I was impressed with all the instances I saw of people pulling together to support each other, and of folks working late in to the evening to make sure things got done. We could not have gotten to where we are today without the kind of collaboration and dedication on your part.
Thank you for all that you do for Travelers”.
Keep up the spirit and momentum…

Retro call
• Keep doing: Something the team is doing well and you recognize the value on it.
• Less of: Something already being done; you see some value but you rather reduce a little bit.
• More of: Something already being done; you believe will bring more value if done even more.
• Stop doing: Something that is not bringing value; or even worse; It is getting on the way
• Start doing: A new idea or something you have seen working before that you would like to bring to the table.

About Stocks (Hariharan)
------------------------
start learning
moneycontrol.com
economictimes/market
marketmojo.com


nice areas  - pharmaceuticals, auto, chemicals, beaverages (especially drinks), energy, medical services (like labs)
make sure never put in telecom and banks.
careful with financial sector as well.
FMCG is good one, but costly.

concentrate on Battery and auto ancillary - as going forward all auto companies are moving to batter operated vehical so all these stocks will go nice for next 5 to 10 years.
